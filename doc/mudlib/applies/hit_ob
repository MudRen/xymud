 
    hit_ob()            Eastern Stories II (23 Sep 1995)           hit_ob()
 
    SYNOPSIS
        mixed hit_ob( object ob, object victim );
 
    APPLIED
        skill daemons (martial/force), weapon, npc.
 
    DESCRIPTION
        hit_ob is called by COMBAT_D when a character hits his/her opponent
        during combat. With this function, you can do extra damage to the
        victim depending on the skill/weapon/npc you are using. Noted that
        if the character is using a weapon, the hit_ob defined within the
        character itself is not called. (i.e. if your draconian is wielding
        a sword, then he cannot breathe fire)
 
        If hit_ob returns a string, the string is added to the combat
        message (between action message and damage message). If an
        integer is returned, the integer is added to the damage bonus for
        that hit. Returned value of other types are ignored.
